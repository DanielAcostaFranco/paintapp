JavaFX Paint Application

This is my Paint application built with JavaFX.
I created this project to practice Java basics and to build a simple interactive program.
The user can draw on a canvas, change colors, adjust the brush size, use an eraser, and clear the canvas.
In this project, I used conditionals, loops, methods, classes, and a Java Collection Framework structure.

Steps to build and/or run the software:

Make sure Java and JavaFX are installed on my computer.
Open the project in VS Code.
Run the App.java file to start the application.

Use the mouse to draw on the canvas.
Change the brush size with the slider, use the eraser, or clear the canvas.
